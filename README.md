# Rider-Community-App

Welcome to the preview repository for the Rider Community App. At present our project is not open source as we are working on publishing the application with Rider. 

This repository features an implementation of the Community App Framework. This framework provides College Campuses with the tools they need to engage students with the campus community. Below are some screen shots and explanation of features for the application.

We utilize Firebase for authentication and storing account data. Theses are the sign in and create accounts page for the app

We divided our application into four sections: College, Clubs, Forum, Account. 

First, College. The purpose of this section is to provide the college with tools to keep their students informed of news and alerts. The college page is divided into a posts and events section. The college can generate posts for students to view and reply to, and they can also create events which students can add to their accounts.

Second, Clubs. The purpose of this section is to provide the Clubs and organizations active on the college's campus to interact with their existing memebers and promote themselves to new ones. The clubs are functionally identical to the college page, such that they can generate posts and events for students.

Third, the student forum. This purpose of this section is direct student to student interaction in a discussion board format. Any student can generate a post and reply to other student's posts.
